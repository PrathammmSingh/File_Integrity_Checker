# File_Integrity_Checker
The File Integrity Checker is a Python tool that calculates and compares file hash values (e.g., SHA-256) to detect any unauthorized changes in files within a specified directory. It alerts the user if a fileâ€™s hash differs, ensuring data integrity and detecting potential tampering.
